TokenDog runs as a local HTTPS proxy between your AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, anything respecting `HTTPS_PROXY`) and `api.anthropic.com`. It intercepts every request the assistant sends, finds the `tool_result` content blocks the model is about to be charged for, and applies tool-specific compression — losslessly, before any tokens are billed.

```

```

## Install

```bash
brew tap uttej-badwane/tokendog
brew install tokendog
td setup
```

That's it. `td setup` handles every step:

1. Generates and trusts a local CA cert (TouchID prompt on macOS)
2. Installs a launchd LaunchAgent so the proxy auto-starts at login
3. Appends `HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888` to your shell rc
4. Sets `HTTPS_PROXY` at the launchd level so macOS GUI apps see it (plus a persistence agent for reboots)
5. Removes any old `td hook claude` PreToolUse entry from `~/.claude/settings.json`
6. Verifies end-to-end with a synthetic Anthropic round-trip

**You must restart your AI client** after setup. Existing shells and running apps have their env locked at startup. Pick the path that matches you:

- **Terminal claude CLI** — open a NEW terminal window and start `claude` there. Or one-shot: `HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888 claude`.
- **Claude.app (Mac)** — quit fully (cmd-Q from menu) and relaunch with the Electron flag, since Electron ignores the standard env var:
  ```bash
  open -a Claude --args --proxy-server=http://127.0.0.1:8888 --proxy-bypass-list='<-loopback>'
  ```

To preview without changes: `td setup --dry-run`. To reverse: `td unsetup`.

### Other install paths

```bash
# Without brew
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uttej-badwane/TokenDog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/uttej-badwane/tokendog:latest
```

Linux/Windows: `td setup` works for everything except cert install + launchd, which are macOS-only today (the command prints platform-specific manual steps for those).

## How it works

```

              api.anthropic.com
```

The proxy MITMs **only** `api.anthropic.com:443` — every other host's CONNECT is tunneled through unchanged. Trust footprint stays small.

Cache safety: only the **last** `tool_result` in the request is filtered. Anthropic's prompt cache hashes content; modifying historical content would invalidate the cache and net cost would go *up*. The last message contains content not yet seen by the API, so filtering it is a pure win. **Cache-safe by construction** — TokenDog is complementary to prompt caching and batch, not a competitor to them.

## Why compress at all (it's not just the bill)

The headline isn't "save 10% on tokens" — token prices keep falling. The durable wins are about **how much of the context window you spend on signal vs noise**:

- **Quality**: less low-signal tool noise in the window means the model spends attention on what matters. Verbose `git status`, refresh spam, duplicated file reads — that's distraction the model pays for twice (in cost *and* in focus).
- **Latency**: fewer input tokens is less to transmit and prefill.
- **Window pressure**: long agentic sessions hit context limits; compaction buys you more turns before truncation kicks in.
- **Cost**: still real, especially at org scale — but the *last* reason now, not the first.

Dedup and reversible compression exist to serve the first three. The byte savings are the easy thing to measure; the freed context budget is the thing that matters.

## Architecture: engine + adapters + frontends

TokenDog is a **provider-neutral compression engine** with swappable frontends — not a single MITM utility.

```
        frontends                    engine                providers
┌────────────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────┐
│ td proxy   (MITM)      │   │                   │   │ anthropic        │
│ td gateway (base_url)  │──▶│  core.Dispatch    │──▶│  /v1/messages    │
│ (future: SDK / LiteLLM │   │  core.Compress    │   │ openai           │
│  / Bedrock middleware) │   │                   │   │  /v1/chat/compl. │
└────────────────────────┘   └───────────────────┘   └──────────────────┘
```

- **`internal/core`** — the engine. `Compress(conversation) → savings` over a provider-neutral `Conversation`. Knows nothing about HTTP, analytics, or any vendor. This is the reusable, testable heart.
- **`internal/adapter/*`** — translate one wire format (Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions) into a `Conversation` and write replacements back. Adding a provider is one adapter; the engine is untouched.
- **frontends** — supply transport + the analytics sink. The MITM proxy and the explicit-base_url `td gateway` are two; an SDK middleware or LiteLLM callback is the same engine wired differently.

## Deployment modes

| Mode | How traffic reaches TD | CA cert? | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`td proxy`** | `HTTPS_PROXY` + MITM of `api.anthropic.com` | yes (local CA) | individual devs who want zero client config |
| **`td gateway`** | SDK `base_url` → `http://127.0.0.1:8099` | **no** | teams / security-conscious setups — explicit, auditable opt-in |
| SDK / gateway plugin *(roadmap)* | library call inside your own AI gateway | no | platform teams running a central LLM gateway |

```bash
# Gateway mode — no trust-store changes, no interception of anything you didn't redirect:
td gateway --port 8099 --upstream https://api.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8099 claude
# or OpenAI: client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8099/v1")
```

## What gets filtered

| Tool | Strategy | Real-world reduction |
|---|---|---|
| `git status/log/diff/branch` | Compact format, drop `index abc..def` metadata | 30-85% |
| `gh pr/issue/run list` | Column-padding normalization, JSON compaction on `gh api` | 30-60% |
| `gh run view --log` | Strip per-line `job\tstep\ttimestamp` prefix repetition | 40-60% |
| `aws/gcloud/az` | Lossless JSON re-marshal, table normalization | 30-80% |
| `kubectl get/describe/top` | Table compaction, blank-line collapse | 20-60% |
| `terraform/tofu plan/apply` | Drop refresh + apply-progress spam, preserve resource diffs verbatim | 40-70% |
| `ls -la` | Drop permissions, owner, timestamps | 55-70% |
| `find` | Group paths by directory, skip `.git` / `node_modules` | 70-95% |
| `grep -rn` | Group matches by file path, dedupe path strings | 30-50% |
| `pytest/jest/vitest/go test/cargo test` | Collapse to summary on all-pass; verbatim on any failure | 60-95% |
| `npm/pnpm/yarn/pip` | Drop fetch/progress noise | 40-80% |
| `jq, curl` (JSON) | Lossless compaction, no indentation | 40-70% |
| `docker ps/images` | Compact tables | 20-40% |
| `make` | Drop successful-compile lines, keep warnings/errors verbatim | 30-70% |
| *(any unhandled command)* | Generic fallback: re-marshal a single JSON value without indentation | 20-60% |

**Lossless principle**: TokenDog never silently drops content. It restructures and removes structural noise. If filtering would lose data, the original passes through unchanged. Every filter has the universal `Guard` invariant: output bytes ≤ input bytes.

## Reversible compression (opt-in)

The lossless filters above are capped at structural cleanup — they can only remove noise, never elide signal, because the model can't get elided bytes back. Reversible compression lifts that ceiling for the long tail of large outputs (especially commands with no per-tool filter, like big log dumps).

Turn it on with `TD_REVERSIBLE=1`. Then, for any tool output still large after the lossless pass, the proxy:

1. Stashes the **full original** locally under `~/.config/tokendog/originals/` (content-addressed, 24h TTL).
2. Replaces it on the wire with a compact preview — the first 20 and last 5 lines — plus a marker:
   ```
   [td:STASHED id=2044d4c9819c — 375 lines / 12.0KB elided. Call the
    td_retrieve tool (tokendog MCP server) with id="2044d4c9819c" to get
    the full original output.]
   ```
3. If the elided middle actually matters, the model calls the `td_retrieve` MCP tool with that id and gets the complete original back.

Nothing is lost — only **deferred** to an on-demand round-trip. The trade is: aggressive savings now (60-90% on large outputs) for one extra tool call in the rare case the middle was needed. It's opt-in because it changes the default lossless behavior. Requires the `tokendog` MCP server registered in your client (`td mcp install`) so `td_retrieve` is callable.

Inspect or clear the store:

```bash
td stash list              # one row per stashed original, newest first
td stash get <id>          # print a stashed original in full
td stash purge             # delete every stashed original
```

Tunables: `TD_STASH_MIN` (min bytes before stashing, default 2048), `TD_STASH_TTL` (retention seconds, default 86400).

### `td learn` — is reversible compression too aggressive?

Every `td_retrieve` call is logged. `td learn` joins those retrievals against the stash events and shows a per-command retrieve rate — how often the model had to pull the full original back because the preview dropped something it needed:

```bash
$ td learn
Stashed (reversible) events:  142
Retrievals logged:            21

Per-command retrieve rate (higher = previews too aggressive):
COMMAND           STASHED  RETRIEVED    RATE
kubectl                40         28     70%  ← previews likely too aggressive
journalctl             55          6     11%
cat                    30          2      7%
```

A high rate is a signal to raise `TD_STASH_MIN` (so that command's output isn't stashed) or treat it as a poor stash candidate. A zero rate means previews are serving cleanly — reversible compression is a pure win for that command. `--json` and `--top N` supported.

## Cross-message dedup

The per-tool filters above shrink each output in isolation. Dedup attacks a different axis: **redundancy across the conversation**. Agents routinely re-emit identical output — re-reading the same file to re-check it, re-running a verbose status command, pasting the same config twice — and each repeat re-bills the full text even though a byte-identical copy already sits earlier in the prompt.

When the **last** message's `tool_result` is byte-for-byte identical to a `tool_result` from an earlier message in the same request, the proxy replaces it with a one-line back-reference:

```
[td: identical to the output of `cat config.yaml` — 4 tool outputs earlier in
 this conversation. Elided to save tokens; the full 3.2KB text appears
 verbatim above.]
```

This is **lossless** (the full copy is verbatim above, in the model's own context — nothing is removed from the conversation) and **cache-safe** (like every proxy transform, it touches only the last message, which the prompt cache hasn't hashed yet). It deliberately covers *any* tool output, not just commands with a filter — re-reading a large file via the Read tool is one of the most common redundancies and has no per-tool filter at all.

On by default; set `TD_NO_DEDUP=1` to disable. Tiny duplicates where the marker would cost more than the content are left untouched by the `Guard` invariant.

## Proving it doesn't hurt quality — `td eval`

"Lossless" and "recoverable" are claims; `td eval` makes them measurable. Each corpus fixture declares the answer-bearing facts a task would actually need from a tool's output (`must_keep`). The harness compresses each fixture through the **real engine** and checks every fact survives — no live model required, fully deterministic, runs in CI.

```
$ td eval
TokenDog Eval — 4 fixtures
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIXTURE                    TRANSFORM    COMP%   INLINE   RECOVER
big-log-reversible         reversible     81%     2/3      3/3  ← 1 need retrieval
duplicate-config-read      dedup          77%     3/3      3/3
git-status-lossless        lossless       26%     3/3      3/3
httpie-json-generic        lossless       77%     4/4      4/4
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aggregate: 3.2KB → 2.4KB (74% of original) · facts 13/13 recoverable (100%), 12/13 inline (92%)
RESULT: PASS — no answer-bearing fact lost
```

Two measures, because they mean different things:

- **inline** — the fact is in the prompt the model receives, no retrieval needed.
- **recoverable** — the fact is reachable *at all*: inline, or via the reversible stash (a `td_retrieve` call), or verbatim earlier in the conversation (a dedup back-reference).

The harness **passes only if every fact is recoverable**. That's the hard line: compression may *defer* a fact to a retrieval (the reversible row above defers one — the OOM error buried mid-log), but it must never *destroy* one. The inline rate is reported as an efficiency signal, not a correctness gate. `td eval` exits non-zero on any lost fact, so it works as a CI gate and as a regression test that a filter never silently drops an answer.

```bash
td eval                     # built-in corpus
td eval --corpus ./fixtures # your own *.json fixtures
td eval --json              # machine-readable
```

## Honest savings expectations

- Tool output (the part TD touches) is typically **30-50% of your Anthropic bill**.
- Per-tool reduction is 30-90% on the bytes TD compresses.
- Net bill reduction in proxy mode for a typical user: **5-15%** depending on how tool-output-heavy the workflow is.
- Run `td replay` against your own transcripts to get your specific number for your actual workflow.

## Three commands worth knowing

### `td gain` — your savings, accurately priced

```bash
td gain                    # all-time totals, per-model rates
td gain --since 7d         # last week
td gain --by-model         # opus / sonnet / haiku split
td gain --by-project       # cross-repo breakdown (.git-rooted detection)
td gain --daily            # day-by-day time series
td gain --json             # pipeable to jq or dashboards
```

### `td replay` — counterfactual: "what if I'd had td running all year?"

```bash
td replay                  # walk every transcript at ~/.claude/projects/
td replay --since 30d      # last 30 days
td replay --json           # machine-readable
```

Reads your historical Claude transcripts, replays each Bash tool_result through current filters, and shows what TD would have saved. Surfaces the top unhandled binaries (your priority list for new filter contributions).

### `td proxy` — the proxy lifecycle

```bash
td proxy daemon status       # is the launchd agent running?
td proxy daemon install      # (re)install the LaunchAgent
td proxy daemon uninstall    # stop and remove the agent
td proxy install-cert        # (re)install the CA cert
td proxy start               # run in foreground (Ctrl-C to stop)
```

Most users only run these via `td setup` — they're here for when something breaks or you want to inspect state.

## Privacy

The proxy sees every byte of every Anthropic API request — including conversation content, tool outputs, and any pasted secrets. Nothing leaves your machine; analytics writes to `~/.config/tokendog/` only. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full data flow and threat model.

The `redact` package scrubs AWS keys, GitHub tokens, Slack tokens, JWTs, and PEM blocks from `td purge --redact` and `td replay --redact` output. The proxy itself does not redact in-flight content (the model needs the originals to do its job).

## MCP integration (Claude Desktop)

```bash
td mcp install     # adds tokendog to claude_desktop_config.json
td mcp doctor      # diagnoses Claude Desktop wiring
```

Exposes 6 tools to Claude Desktop: five read-only analytics queries (so you can ask "how much has TokenDog saved me this week?" in chat) plus `td_retrieve`, which serves originals stashed by [reversible compression](#reversible-compression-opt-in).

The engine (`internal/core`) is provider- and transport-agnostic. Adding a **provider** is one adapter implementing `core.Provider`; adding a **filter** is one file + one line in `internal/filter/registrations.go`; adding a **frontend** (gateway, SDK middleware) is wiring a transport to `core.Dispatch`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
